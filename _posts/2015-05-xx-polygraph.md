_Occasionally [Kevin "@bfist" Thompson](https://twitter.com/bfist) gets a bee
in his bonnet about something and decides to write about it on this blog. Why?
Nobody knows but we're happy to have his contributions_

> I want to talk about the case itself and what he appears to be in trouble
for but also talk about the folly of the poly (ooh, maybe that's the title
of this post). I think my conclusion is that the dude did commit fraud but his
sentence should be really light because of the sillyness of the polygraph.

> I think I also want to talk about whether this knowledge should be a secret.
Is this a national security issue? Is polygraph weakness in the same category
as classified information about drone construction?

# TL;DR
People selling training on how to beat a polygraph exam are probably guilty of
fraud but the penalty should reflect that they didn't defraud their customers.
The real victims of their fraud are the organizations which are also defrauding
themselves by relying on this horribly inaccurate measurement. The penalty should
also reflect that with a little care in how the training providers market their
material their product could be 100% legal.

# The folly of the poly
[Today I read an article](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/polygraph-com-owner-pleads-guilty-to-training-customers-to-beat-polygraph/) about Douglas Williams, the man behind polygraph.com,
who pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and mail fraud charges for teaching
people how to beat the lie detector tests used by three-letter agencies as part
of their employment process. I was intrigued because I wondered how, in the
United States with our strong first amendment protections, could someone be
guilty of a crime for sharing knowledge. This strikes a chord with me in part
because I'm also an educator and I have a deep loathing of the concept of
forbidden knowledge. Finally, of course, I'm interested because there are very
real problems with the polygraph and in a way this is very similar to the
punishing of security researchers that find flaws in software.

I'm going to make a bold claim here, *"I can beat a polygraph."* I'll go even
further and say that *"I can give completely false answers and pass a polygraph
exam."* However, I feel like that statement has to be tempered with *"I can also
give completely truthful answers and fail a polygraph exam."*

This claim is not even in dispute. [The Global Polygraph network claims](http://www.polytest.org/lie-detector-polygraph-information.asp) that a
properly done polygraph is 90-95% accurate. There are several other sources that
repeat the 90% claim but I haven't been able to figure out if that claim means that
90% of liars will be detected or if that means that 90% of individual lies will
be caught. Still, that 90% rate is for a single-issue test, meaning that they're
only going to ask about a single topic. By their own numbers, a multiple issue
test will have about 80% accuracy. Also, the number of relevant questions matters.
To quote from the above link:

> In general, the more relevant questions asked the less accurate the results
will be. ... Adding even one question to a specific issue test double the error
rate.

So if I were taking a polygraph intended to simulate the test that DHS would give
me as part of their employment screening the best case scenario is that one out
of five times I would fail even if I gave truthful answers. However, if they ask
multiple questions about the issues of concern (drug use, criminal associates, etc) then
we might be looking at failing 2 out of 5 times in the best case scenario. If
there are any problems around question design or techniques used this can easily
get to be a 50/50 crap shoot.

And in fact other scientific sources seem to indicate that it is exactly that.
I am blatantly stealing sources from Wikipedia here, but the National Academy of
Sciences has thoroughly ripped the poly to shreds. I appreciate, in particular,
their point that even if the test was as accurate as claimed, it would still be
terrible for detecting spies because of the [Base rate fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy). You would reject thousands
of qualified truthful candidates to weed out some of the spies.
