_Occasionally [Kevin "@bfist" Thompson](https://twitter.com/bfist) gets a bee
in his bonnet about something and decides to write about it on this blog. Why?
Nobody knows but we're happy to have his contributions_

of this post). I think my conclusion is that the dude did commit fraud but his
sentence should be really light because of the sillyness of the polygraph.

Is this a national security issue? Is polygraph weakness in the same category
as classified information about drone construction?

[Today I read an article](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/polygraph-com-owner-pleads-guilty-to-training-customers-to-beat-polygraph/) about Douglas Williams, the man behind polygraph.com,
who plead guilty to obstruction of justice and mail fraud charges for teaching
people how to beat the lie detector tests used by three-letter agencies as part
of their employment process. I was intrigued because I wondered how, in the
United States with our strong first amendment protections, could someone be
guilty of a crime for sharing knowledge. This strikes a chord with me in part
because I'm also an educator and I have a deep loathing of the concept of
forbidden knowledge. Finally, of course, I'm interested because there are very
real problems with the polygraph and in a way this is very similar to the
punishing of security researchers that find flaws in software.


I'm going to make a bold claim here, *"I can beat a polygraph."* I'll go even
further and say that *"I can give completely false answers and pass a polygraph
exam."* However, I feel like that statement has to be tempered with *"I can also
give completely truthful answers and fail a polygraph exam."*
